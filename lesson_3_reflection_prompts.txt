When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I do not want to waste time in committing via command line.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I want to have the choice to reflect the changes on Github to my local directory.
