When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I do not want to waste time in committing via command line.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forking means copying a Github repository to your own Github account.
Cloning means downloading a Guthub repo to your local machine.
Branching means making a new head for the commits.
Use as per requirement.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

So that we are always close to the remote, and we have a working directory to start with.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Using Google Drive or Screen Sharing. It would be much harder.
