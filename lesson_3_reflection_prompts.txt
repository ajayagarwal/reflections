When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I do not want to waste time in committing via command line.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I want to have the choice to reflect the changes on Github to my local directory.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forking means copying a Github repository to your own Github account.
Cloning means downloading a Guthub repo to your local machine.
Branching means making a new head for the commits.
Use as per requirement.
