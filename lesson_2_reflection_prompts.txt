What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git file is created inside the repository which means it is now ready to

can be tracked.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area contains the files that have been tracked by git since the last
changes were made, but have not yet been committed. The repository contains the
committed files. The value is that we can double-check before actually committing.
